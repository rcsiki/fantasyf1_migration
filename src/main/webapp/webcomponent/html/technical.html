				The major change for 2011 will be the Pirelli tires. The degradation 
				of the new Pirelli tire has some top drivers worried. 
				On the other hand the tire degradation has been called for by many 
				stakeholders as a positive factor that ought to improve the show.
				<p>
				Under new moveable bodywork regulations for next season, drivers will 
				be able to adjust their car's rear wing from the cockpit.
				The rear-wing system will be electronically governed and will only be 
				available for activation when a driver is less than one second behind 
				another at pre-determined points on the track. It will then be disabled 
				once the driver brakes. The FIA hopes the system will boost overtaking 
				opportunities during races.
				<p>
				Although the adjustable rear wing can be used at all times during 
				practice sessions and qualifying, it can only be activated once a driver
				has completed at least two laps of the race itself. Like KERS 
				(which will reintroduced next season after the teams agreed to suspend 
				its use in 2010) the system won’t be compulsory.
				<p>
				In other changes, minimum car weight has been raised by 20kg to 640kg, 
				to give teams running KERS more flexibility in terms of weight 
				distribution, a second tether will be added to every wheel to improve 
				safety and F-ducts and double diffusers have been banned.
				<p>
				As well as their technical revisions, the FIA have also updated the 
				sporting regulations for 2011. Gearboxes will need to last for five 
				races, instead of four, whilst a curfew will be imposed on team 
				personnel connected with the operation of the cars. This will last 
				between midnight to 6am when practice is scheduled to start at 10am, 
				or 1am to 7am if practice is scheduled to start at 11am.
				<p>
				Drivers will receive three sets of dry weather Pirelli tyres to use in 
				P1 and P2 and must return one set after each session. A further eight 
				sets will then be at their disposal for the rest of the race weekend, 
				although one set of each specification must be handed back before 
				qualifying.
				<p>
				If a driver fails to use both specifications of dry weather tyres 
				during a race, they will be excluded from the results. If a race is 
				suspended and can’t be restarted, and a driver has failed to use both 
				sets of tyres, 30 seconds will be added to the driver’s race time.
				<p>
				During the first phase of qualifying, any driver who fails to set a 
				lap within 107 percent of the fastest time will not be allowed to start 
				the race. However, in exceptional circumstances, which could include a 
				driver setting a suitable time during practice, the stewards may permit 
				the car to start.
				<p>
				The refreshed sporting regulations also contain several references to 
				driving protocol, with aggressively defensive manoeuvres, gaining an 
				advantage by leaving the track, pit-lane overtaking and the correct 
				way to respond to waved blue flags all mentioned.
